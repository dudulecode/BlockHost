BlockHost is an easy-to-use tool for managing your Minecraft server.
It is completly written in Python and can be easily modified by the user.

Get started
-----------

Please read the `documentation <https://github.com/dudulecode/BlockHost/master/docs/instructions.rst>`_ for
a full introduction. I tried to keep it simple and short. The EMSM will
be installed in less than 10 minutes.
